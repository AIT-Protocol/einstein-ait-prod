### Subnet Purpose

Einstein-AIT subnet aims to:

- Host a fine-tuning competition for AI/ML models specialized in mathematics and computational reasoning.
- Produce a revenue-generating subscription business through a front-end Math and Data analytics LLM application, leveraging RLFH via real user feedback and response rating.
- Open-source and fine-tune a custom AI/ML model trained on a robust dataset, including a cleaned MIT-IDSS mathematics dataset.

### Subnet Objective

To provide real-world users with an ever-improving AI/ML model capable of computing complex mathematics and data analytics, adapting to the user's education level, and providing appropriate justifications for its results.

### Subnet Product Breakdown

- **Open Source**: Specialized mathematics ML model trained on various datasets, including proprietary data from MIT Institute for Data Systems and Society (IDSS).
- **Hugging Face Leaderboard**: For fine-tuning the model and allowing miners to compete with custom models.
- **Front-End Application**: Revenue-generating business model.

### Key Features
- 🚀 **Advanced Computational Network**: Incentivizing miners to enhance computational resources for complex AI/ML tasks.
- 📈 **Performance Commitment**: Miners commit to a model type and task volume.
- 💰 **Incentive Mechanism**: 
  - `reward = (0.6 * accuracy_score) + (0.3 * reasoning_score) + (0.1 * time_score)`
  - `accuracy_score` is based on the correctness of the result.
  - `reasoning_score` measures the similarity between the generated text and reference data.
  - `time_score` is derived from the time taken to generate the result.
- 🌟 **Continuous Improvement**: Introducing new models and features based on demand.
- 💵 **Earn as a Validator**: Validators earn by sharing computational resources with miners.
