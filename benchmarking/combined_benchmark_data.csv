Find the point of intersection of the two lines: $y = \frac{-3}{6}x - 2$ and $y = x - 2$,"$(0, -2)$","To find the point of intersection of two lines, we need to set their equations equal to each other and solve for the values of \(x\) and \(y\).

Given lines:
1. \(y = \frac{-3}{6}x - 2\)  (equation 1)
2. \(y = x - 2\)  (equation 2)

Setting equation 1 equal to equation 2:
\(\frac{-3}{6}x - 2 = x - 2\)

Simplify the equation:
\(\frac{-1}{2}x - 2 = x - 2\)
\(\frac{-1}{2}x - x = 0\)
\(-\frac{3}{2}x = 0\)

Solving for \(x\):
\(-\frac{3}{2}x = 0\)
\(x = 0\)

Now, substitute \(x = 0\) back into either equation to find \(y\). Using equation 2:
\(y = 0 - 2\)
\(y = -2\)

Therefore, the point of intersection of the two lines is (0, -2).

So the final answer is: the point of intersection is (0, -2)","(0, -2).",8.78910231590271,8.399175882339478,1.0,1.0,2729.0,0.0016714999999999998,359.0,0.01557

Then, we can use the formula for the confidence interval:

\[ \text{Confidence Interval} = \text{Mean} \pm \left( \text{Critical value} \times \frac{\text{Standard Deviation}}{\sqrt{n}} \right) \]

Given sample: $[204, 294, 280, 252, 227, 212, 296, 207, 253, 273, 213, 286, 205, 283, 250, 237, 235, 236, 223, 246, 264, 255, 295]$

Step 1: Calculate the mean of the sample
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \]
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{204+294+280+252+227+212+296+207+253+273+213+286+205+283+250+237+235+236+223+246+264+255+295}{23} \]
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{5901}{23} \]
\[ \text{Mean} \approx 256.57 \]

Step 2: Calculate the standard deviation of the sample
\[ \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \text{Mean})^2} \]
\[ \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\frac{(204-256.57)^2 + (294-256.57)^2 + \ldots + (295-256.57)^2}{22}} \]
\[ \text{Standard Deviation} \approx 30.68 \]

Step 3: Find the critical value for a $90\%$ confidence interval with $n-1=22$ degrees of freedom. From a t-distribution table, the critical value is approximately $1.646$.

Step 4: Calculate the confidence interval
\[ \text{Confidence Interval} = 256.57 \pm \left( 1.646 \times \frac{30.68}{\sqrt{23}} \right) \]
\[ \text{Confidence Interval} = 256.57 \pm (1.646 \times 6.41) \]
\[ \text{Confidence Interval} = 256.57 \pm 10.55 \]

The resulting matrix will have the same number of rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as the second matrix.

Given the dimensions of the matrices:
- The first matrix is a 10x6 matrix (10 rows, 6 columns).
- The second matrix is a 6x10 matrix (6 rows, 10 columns).

Therefore, the resulting matrix will be a 10x10 matrix.

Performing the matrix multiplication will involve multiplying corresponding elements and summing them up. 

After performing the matrix multiplication, the resulting matrix is:

"Find the orthogonal projection of $[-7, 8]$ onto $[-3, 2]$","$[\frac{-111}{13}, \frac{74}{13}]$","To find the orthogonal projection of a vector $\mathbf{v}$ onto a vector $\mathbf{u}$, we can use the formula:

Given $\mathbf{v} = [-7, 8]$ and $\mathbf{u} = [-3, 2]$, we can calculate the orthogonal projection as follows:

1. Calculate the dot product of $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{u}$:
\[
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u} = (-7)(-3) + (8)(2)

2. Calculate the magnitude of $\mathbf{u}$:
\[
\|\mathbf{u}\| = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 2^2}
\]

3. Plug these values into the formula to find the projection:
\[
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{v}) = \left(\frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\|\mathbf{u}\|^2}\right)\mathbf{u}
\]

So the final answer is: the projection of $[-7, 8]$ onto $[-3, 2]$ is $\left(\frac{10}{13}\right)[-3, 2]$.","$[-\frac{111}{13}, \frac{74}{13}]$",8.941240787506104,15.112541198730469,0.21820859320859323,1.0,2754.0,0.0017360000000000001,489.0,0.02379

Where $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}$ is the dot product of the two vectors, $|\vec{a}|$ and $|\vec{b}|$ are the magnitudes of the vectors, and $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors.

Calculating the dot product of the given vectors:
