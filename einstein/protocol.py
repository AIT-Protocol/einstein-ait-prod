class CoreSynapse(bt.Synapse):
    """
    The CoreSynapse subclass of the Synapse class encapsulates the functionalities related to prompting scenarios.

    It specifies three fields - `roles`, `messages` and `completion` - that define the state of the CoreSynapse object.
    The `roles` and `messages` are read-only fields defined during object initialization, and `completion` is a mutable
    field that can be updated as the prompting scenario progresses.

    The Config inner class specifies that assignment validation should occur on this class (validate_assignment = True),
    meaning value assignments to the instance fields are checked against their defined types for correctness.

    Attributes:
        roles (List[str]): A list of roles in the prompting scenario. This field is both mandatory and immutable.
        messages (List[str]): A list of messages in the prompting scenario. This field is both mandatory and immutable.
        completion (str): A string that captures completion of the prompt. This field is mutable.
        required_hash_fields List[str]: A list of fields that are required for the hash.

    Methods:
        deserialize() -> "CoreSynapse": Returns the instance of the current object.


    The `CoreSynapse` class also overrides the `deserialize` method, returning the
    instance itself when this method is invoked. Additionally, it provides a `Config`
    inner class that enforces the validation of assignments (`validate_assignment = True`).

    Here is an example of how the `CoreSynapse` class can be used:

    ```python
    # Create a CoreSynapse instance
    prompt = CoreSynapse(roles=["system", "user"], messages=["Hello", "Hi"])

    # Print the roles and messages
    print("Roles:", prompt.roles)
    print("Messages:", prompt.messages)

    # Update the completion
    model_prompt =... # Use prompt.roles and prompt.messages to generate a prompt
    for your LLM as a single string.
    prompt.completion = model(model_prompt)

    # Print the completion
    print("Completion:", prompt.completion)
    ```

    This will output:
    ```
    Roles: ['system', 'user']
    Messages: ['You are a helpful assistant.', 'Hi, what is the meaning of life?']
    Completion: "The meaning of life is 42. Deal with it, human."
    ```

    This example demonstrates how to create an instance of the `CoreSynapse` class, access the
    `roles` and `messages` fields, and update the `completion` field.

class StreamCoreSynapse(bt.StreamingSynapse):
    """
    StreamCoreSynapse is a specialized implementation of the `StreamingSynapse` tailored for prompting functionalities within
    the Bittensor network. This class is intended to interact with a streaming response that contains a sequence of tokens,
    which represent prompts or messages in a certain scenario.

    As a developer, when using or extending the `StreamCoreSynapse` class, you should be primarily focused on the structure
    and behavior of the prompts you are working with. The class has been designed to seamlessly handle the streaming,
    decoding, and accumulation of tokens that represent these prompts.

    Attributes:
    - `roles` (List[str]): A list of roles involved in the prompting scenario. This could represent different entities
                           or agents involved in the conversation or use-case. They are immutable to ensure consistent
                           interaction throughout the lifetime of the object.

    - `messages` (List[str]): These represent the actual prompts or messages in the prompting scenario. They are also
                              immutable to ensure consistent behavior during processing.

    - `completion` (str): Stores the processed result of the streaming tokens. As tokens are streamed, decoded, and
                          processed, they are accumulated in the completion attribute. This represents the "final"
                          product or result of the streaming process.
    - `required_hash_fields` (List[str]): A list of fields that are required for the hash.

    Methods:
    - `process_streaming_response`: This method asynchronously processes the incoming streaming response by decoding
                                    the tokens and accumulating them in the `completion` attribute.

    - `deserialize`: Converts the `completion` attribute into its desired data format, in this case, a string.

    - `extract_response_json`: Extracts relevant JSON data from the response, useful for gaining insights on the response's
                               metadata or for debugging purposes.

    Note: While you can directly use the `StreamCoreSynapse` class, it's designed to be extensible. Thus, you can create
    subclasses to further customize behavior for specific prompting scenarios or requirements.
